           <h2>A Story about my life</h2>
           <p> class="pstyle"
                I was born in Brooklyn on February 28th, 2001.
                2 years later, my family moved to Pennsylvania, so I grew up 2 hours away from where I was born.
                On my 7th birthday, I decided I wanted to make video games, and my sister told my that the high school I'd be going to offered classes.
                During my Freshman year of high school, I took Web Design and Intro. to Java, and learned 4 languages.
                From then on, after much enjoyment with everything I did (And earning 150/100 in Web design), I decided my career choice:
                Programmer.
